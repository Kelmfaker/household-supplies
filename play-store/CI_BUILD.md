CI TWA build (GitHub Actions)

This workflow builds the Android App Bundle (AAB) for the Trusted Web Activity using Bubblewrap in GitHub Actions.

Required repository secrets (set in GitHub Settings â†’ Secrets):
 
 Optional secret for GitHub Pages assetlinks (used by the Pages deploy workflow):
 - ASSETLINKS_JSON: Raw JSON string for `assetlinks.json`. If set, the Pages workflow will write this
   file into `out/.well-known/assetlinks.json` before publishing, so it will be available at the origin
   root as `/.well-known/assetlinks.json`.
 
 Helper (local PowerShell):
 1. Edit `play-store/assetlinks.json` with your `package_name` and `sha256_cert_fingerprints`.
 2. Run:
 ```powershell
 .\scripts\assetlinks_to_secret.ps1
 ```
 3. Copy the printed RAW JSON and paste into the repository secret `ASSETLINKS_JSON`.

Publishing options for manifest/assetlinks
- If you want to host only the PWA assets (manifest + icons + assetlinks) on GitHub Pages, use the `deploy-public-pages.yml` workflow which publishes the `public/` directory as the Pages site. This is the simplest route to expose `manifest.json` and `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` over HTTPS.

To use it:
1. Ensure `public/manifest.json` and `public/icons/*` are correct.
2. Set `ASSETLINKS_JSON` secret as described above (optional but required for TWA verification).
3. Push to `main` or run the `Publish public/ to GitHub Pages` workflow manually. Then enable GitHub Pages to serve `gh-pages` branch.

Notes about origin-root for assetlinks
- Play Store requires `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` at the origin root (e.g., `https://kelmfaker.github.io/.well-known/assetlinks.json`). If you publish a repo site at `/repo` path, the workflow will still put `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` at the origin root when you publish `public/` as the Pages site (the gh-pages branch becomes the origin root for that Pages site).


How it works
- The workflow decodes `KEYSTORE_BASE64` to `play-store/my-release-key.jks`.
- It populates `play-store/bubblewrap-config.json` with the keystore path and passwords to a temporary `play-store/bubblewrap-config.ci.json` file.
- Runs `bubblewrap build` to generate the AAB.
- Uploads the produced AAB as a workflow artifact named `twa-aab` that you can download from the Actions UI.

Trigger
- Manually via the Actions tab (Run workflow) or by pushing to `main`.

Security notes
- Keep your keystore and passwords secret. Use repository secrets and avoid committing keys or passwords.
